 Overview of the Project

 Project Overview: Basic Python Calculator

 Objective
The objective of this project is to create a simple, interactive calculator program using Python. The calculator will prompt the user to enter two numbers and select an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). Based on the user's input, the program will perform the chosen operation and display the result.

 Key Components

1. *User Input*:
   - Prompt the user to input two numerical values.
   - Ask the user to select an arithmetic operation from a given list.

2. *Arithmetic Operations*:
   - Implement functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - Ensure division by zero is handled gracefully.

3. *Control Flow*:
   - Use conditional statements to execute the appropriate arithmetic function based on the userâ€™s choice.

4. *Output*:
   - Display the result of the chosen arithmetic operation to the user.

Implementation Details

- *Function Definitions*: 
  - Four separate functions will be defined for each arithmetic operation: add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide().
  
- *Error Handling*: 
  - Validate user input to ensure it is numeric.
  - Handle division by zero in the divide() function.

- *User Interaction*: 
  - Use the input() function to collect user inputs and choices.
  - Print the result of the calculation using the print() function.

 Learning Outcomes

- *Basic Python Syntax*: Gain familiarity with basic Python syntax and operations.
- *Function Creation*: Learn how to define and call functions.
- *Input/Output Operations*: Understand how to handle user input and display output.
- *Error Handling*: Implement basic error handling techniques.
- *Control Structures*: Use conditional
